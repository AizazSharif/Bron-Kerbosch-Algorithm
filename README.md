# Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm

A code that implements the BK algorithm and is able to show you the following:
1. All maximal cliques within a graph
2. The maximum clique from within set of Maximal cliques

Example output for a randomly generated graph of 100 vertices and

Example output for a randomly generated graph of 100 vertices and 3000 edges is as follows:
Maximal:
U.V = { 0, 1, 12, 20, 38, 81 }
U.V = { 1, 2, 3, 6 }
U.V = { 2, 3, 6, 16, 46 }
U.V = { 3, 6, 16, 24, 37 }
U.V = { 4, 5, 7, 11, 18, 96 }
U.V = { 5, 7, 10, 11, 18, 96 }
U.V = { 8, 10, 15, 35, 96 }
U.V = { 9, 11, 12, 34, 39, 69 }
U.V = { 16, 17, 18, 24, 74 }
U.V = { 22, 28, 32, 39, 58, 69,
U.V = { 23, 24, 29, 37, 38, 50,
U.V = { 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 38,
U.V = { 26, 27, 32, 34, 38 }
U.V = { 61, 62, 68, 95 }
U.V = { 71, 75, 76, 79 }
U.V = { 75, 76, 79, 88, 91 }
Maximum:
U.V = { 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 38,
95 }
53 }
58, 69 }
58, 69 }

## Installation and Usage

* Install 
  * gcc (latest version)
* Clone the repo and go to directory


```
$ git clone https://github.com/AizazSharif/Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm.git
$ cd Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm

```
* Run 'gcc main.c' commmand to create the binary.
* Make Changes in the Vertices and Edges of Graph for experiment.
