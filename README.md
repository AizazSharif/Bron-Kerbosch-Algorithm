# Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm

A code that implements the BK algorithm and is able to show you the following:
1. All maximal cliques within a graph
2. The maximum clique from within set of Maximal cliques

Example output For a Graph


G.V = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
G.E = { 1->2, 1->3, 2->3, 2->4, 3->5, 4->5 }


Maximal Clique : C.V = { 1, 2, 3 }
Maximal Clique : C.V = { 2, 4 }
Maximal Clique : C.V = { 3, 5 }
Maximal Clique : C.V = { 4, 5 }

Maximum:  C.V = { 1, 2, 3 }


## Installation and Usage

* Install 
  * gcc (latest version)
* Clone the repo and go to directory


```
$ git clone https://github.com/AizazSharif/Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm.git
$ cd Bron-Kerbosch-Algorithm

```
* Run 'gcc main.c' command to create the binary.
* Make Changes in the Vertices and Edges of Graph for experiment.
